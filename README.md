# NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAn

This is the first piece of code that I thought it was a good idea to save on a flash drive for years.  
It is a copy of [Nyan.Cat](http://www.nyan.cat) that I made when I was 15  

Made in visual studio 2010, binaries already built since I don't know if i can build again but also relied on images/pictures in the debug folder.

I drew 4 frames of nyan cat myself in the visual studio icon editor

## Usage
build/run `NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAn\bin\Debug\NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAn.exe`
